        <p>Hi! My name is <b>Adrian Nicholas L</b>, but you can call me Ian. I'm an <b>Informatics Engineering student</b> based in Manado, Indonesia. Alongside my studies, I work as a freelance web designer and graphic designer.</p>

        <p> I have a strong passion for everything related to design, especially how visuals can enhance user experience and communicate ideas effectively. Whether it's building clean, responsive websites or crafting engaging visual content,
            I love bringing creative ideas to life through design.
